# Activity: Algorithms Practice 

This activity contains four coding challenges designed to give you practice authoring algorithms. Take your time and read the instructions carefully. Complete the functions by implementing the algorithm and returning the desired result. Read the instructions to determine how to assess your code.

You'll find all of the functions in main.js.

The test.js file contains tests for all of the functions in this activity. Do not change any code in test.js. To see the output from test.js and to evaluate your work, open index.html in Chrome and view the console in the Developer Tools. You'll know that you are finding success when all of the console.log statements print 'true'.
